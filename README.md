# Exploring Modern iOS Architectures

#### :movie_camera: About
In this project I'm structuring my knowledge about modern architectural patterns,
showcasing the main features through a simple Movie app. The app makes use of
the Tmdb API which requires an API key. However, static
`JSON` files are also included for quick usage.

#### :nut_and_bolt: Setup
###### With static JSON
1. In Xcode, choose a target / architecture
2. Build and run!

###### With real requests
1. [Request an API key](http://https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api) at themoviedb.org
2. Insert your key in `TmdbAPIKey.plist` located at the root of the repo
3. In Xcode, choose a target / architecture
4. Build and run!
